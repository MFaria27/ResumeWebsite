                    <p>
                        Spotify is one of, if not the most popular music streaming service used today. 
                        What many people don't know is that Spotify has strangely specific data on each 
                        song uploaded to its platform. Numerical values ranging from how danceable a song 
                        is to how happy the tone of the song is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project was created to visually display interesting Spotify data in order to 
                        analyze and hopefully answer the question: "What makes a song popular?"
                    </p>
                    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
                    <p>
                        Gathering the data was done using Spotify's python library, Spotipy. 
                        Yhe API allowed for the scraping of song information, audio information, and 
                        each song's calculated popularity scores. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to get the best grasp of what trends "Popular" songs follow, I gave Spotipy 
                        the playlist ID's of the top tracks of 2018 - 2021, each of which contained either 50 
                        or 100 songs on Spotify's most popular songs of those years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After some data analysis and cleaning, the code produced a csv file of 250 songs and 
                        their data curated by Spotify.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Visual</h2>
                    <img src="projects/SpotifyVis/SpotifyProjectThumbnail.png" style="width:80%">
                    <p>
                        Created using the Javascript libaray D3, the website contains 4 tabs, each representing 
                        a different "top tracks of the year" playlist with 6 graphs each.
                            
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All graphs have the same Y-Axis which represents a song's <b>popularity</b> calculated by Spotify. 
                        Each graph has a different X-Axis, representing the numerical score of a songs 
                        <b>Danceability, Loudness, Liveness, Speechiness, Energy and Valance.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                          Each graph has the same songs which connects every graph. For Example:
                    </p>
                    <img src="projects/SpotifyVis/Selected.png">
                    <p>
                        In the above screenshot, I went into the 2020 tab and selected the song "Bad Guy" by 
                        Billie Eilish in the "Loudness" graph. Doing so has highlighted where the song is on 
                        every graph and also shown the score associated with the song/category in the title 
                        of the graph. Selecting another song or clicking the blank space of a graph will deselect
                        a song.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From this data, the songs that are seen as "popular" in the past 4 years have some 
                        common traits such as:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>High Energy</li>
                        <li>Generally Louder</li>
                        <li>Very "Danceable"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The one graph that doesn't really show anything is the Valence graph, which shows that 
                        a song doesn't have to be "Happy" or "Sad" to be popular.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Going Forward</h2>
                    <p>
                        Creating this visualization was pretty interesting, as it taught me the intricacies of 
                        visualizing data and just how much you can add to make illustrations interesting yet 
                        infomative. There are a couple things that I would like to add to make the visuals better:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A Spotify music player (So you can listen to the music you select)</li>
                        <li>Maybe adding "Popularity" to the Y-Axis of each graph</li>
                        <li>More songs that aren't as popular</li>
                        <li>A song selector to look up points</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>
                        Spotify stores many metrics/data on pretty much all the songs uploaded to their 
                        platform. One of these data points is a calculated, numerical score representing 
                        a song's "popularity." 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a song had a popularity index of 10, one could 
                        assume the song was gaining traction, but was not very popular. A score of 90 
                        would mean that the song was very popular, and that anything above that would 
                        be in the list of top tracks on Spotify.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With all this musical data translated into numerical form, my partner, Alvin Lee, 
                        and I would attempt to use machine learning in order to predict what makes a song 
                        popular with the question <b>"How will my song be received?"</b>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
                    <p>
                        When creating our algorithm, we needed to create a large, clean dataset in order 
                        to properly start. To find the data, we used Spotify's API python library, Spotipy. 
                        Spotipy allowed us to scrap a songs information, such as:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Song Information:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Artist</li>
                            <li>Album</li>
                            <li>Track Name</li>
                            <li>Track ID</li>
                            <li>Release Date</li>
                            <li>Explicity</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Audio Information:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Danceability</li>
                            <li>Energy</li>
                            <li>Keli>
                            <li>Loudness</li>
                            <li>Mode</li>
                            <li>Speechiness</li>
                            <li>Instrumentalness</li>
                            <li>Liveness</li>
                            <li>Valence</li>
                            <li>Tempo</li>
                            <li>Duration</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>A Popularity Score (representing how "popular" a song is out of 100)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        With these as the features used to train our algorithm, we scraped a collection 
                        of Spotify's top tracks playlists and the largest playlist of songs we could find 
                        for our dataset.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For anyone wondering, the large playlist was made by user DuckLover/F4F/Fox&WoldTeamAnim, and was 
                        10,122 songs long! <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1151nuJMpCvYjgPaN1HCRk" target="_blank">Here</a> is a link to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After cleaning some of the data; which included turning the key and mode String values 
                        into numerical values, transforming the date released into a single number representing 
                        the year released and checking and erasing null values for training; we began the creation 
                        of our algorithm.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Training/Predicting Song Popularity</h2>
                    <p>
                        To begin, we took a csv of our fully processed data and split it by 30% for testing data and 
                        70% for training data. 
                        We trained our model with a Random Forest Regression in order to use both categorial 
                        and continuous numeric features to produce a numeric prediction. 
                        After fitting the model with our training data and predicting with the test data, we got a 
                        RMSE of around 15 with a margin of error of +/- 30.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While being 30 "popularity points" off isn't the best metric, it is pretty good seeing as 
                        we had a relatively small dataset to work with. To improve this score, we would want to add 
                        more data and more varied data, as working with more, different data will usually lead to better 
                        predictions. It would also be good to try and scrape more data, such as genres, that we weren't able to 
                        find using Spotipy. We also wanted to vizualize a dashboard using our prediction model so users could 
                        "create" a theorectical song and see if it would do good (I might take up that project in the 
                        future!).

                    <p>
                        <b>Duck Hunt</b>, a game created by Nintendo in 1984, is a retro shooter game where the player
                        takes the role of a hunter shooting ducks for points. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the original game, players would be greeted with the U.I. above. A counter with how many 
                        ducks would be flying by, how many shots they get, a score, and the screen in which ducks 
                        will periodically fly by. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>The Assignment</h2>
                    <p>
                        During a summer computer science program at WPI, we were tasked with each creating 
                        a random website to present in a week. After learning the basics of Javascript, 
                        I challenged myself by trying to make a playable game using html and javascript.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I had experience making more tabletop games in java such as Othello, Chess and checkers, 
                        so I wanted to make a game where time somewhat mattered. I thought about recreating other 
                        retro games, but ultimately went with Duck Hunt.
                    </p>
                    <h2>The Project</h2>
                    <img src="projects/Duck Hunt/DuckHuntStart.png"> 
                    <p>
                        On loading the website, users will be greeted with the above screen, displaying 
                        the background, shots counters and the score. On the bottom of the screen there is 
                        a start button; clicking it will prompt the user the following:
                    </p>
                    <img src="projects/Duck Hunt/prompt.png">
                    <p>
                        This will be the "rounds" of ducks. One round will include 10 ducks flying by and any 
                        more user input rounds will be increased by 10 per round (3 rounds is 30 ducks). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After entering the rounds, the countdown of 3 seconds will begin. A single duck will 
                        fly by with a randomly determined start point on the left of the screen and fly to 
                        another random point on the right. If the user clicks on a flying duck, the duck object 
                        will be replaced by an explosion adding 1000 points to the user's score. This will 
                        continue until all birds have flown.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Going Forward</h2>
                    <p>
                        This was a pretty old project and revisiting it, so with feedback from friends who 
                        generally enjoyed the accessability of a Duck Hunt game hosted on a website, I can 
                        think of a couple things I would like to add:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A score modifier for multiple shots in a row</li>
                        <li>A better, more visible start button</li>
                        <li>Maybe use cookies or a save feature to keep track of scores</li>
                        <li>A global high-score board</li>
                        <li>More easy-to-understand "round" mechanic (Switch from a set number of birds to increasingly faster birds flying until a certain condition is met)</li>
                        <li>Better visuals</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Most of these additions are definitely possible, so this will probably be the project 
                        I revisit first to make improvements. Overall, This was definitely one of my more fun 
                        projects so I hope more people can enjoy this website!
